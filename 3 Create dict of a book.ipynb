      "Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home\n",
      "\n",
      "and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings\n",
      "\n",
      "of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world\n",
      "\n",
      "with very little to distress or vex her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate,\n",
      "\n",
      "indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister's marriage,\n",
      "\n",
      "been mistress of his house from a very early period.  Her mother\n",
      "\n",
      "had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct\n",
      "\n",
      "remembrance of her caresses; and her place had been supplied\n",
      "\n",
      "by an excellent woman as governess, who had fallen little short\n",
      "\n",
      "of a mother in affection.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse's family,\n",
      "\n",
      "less as a governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters,\n",
      "\n",
      "but particularly of Emma.  Between _them_ it was more the intimacy\n",
      "\n",
      "of sisters.  Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal\n",
      "\n",
      "office of governess, the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed\n",
      "\n",
      "her to impose any restraint; and the shadow of authority being\n",
      "\n",
      "now long passed away, they had been living together as friend and\n",
      "\n",
      "friend very mutually attached, and Emma doing just what she liked;\n",
      "\n",
      "highly esteeming Miss Taylor's judgment, but directed chiefly by\n",
      "\n",
      "her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The real evils, indeed, of Emma's situation were the power of having\n",
      "\n",
      "rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little\n",
      "\n",
      "too well of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened\n",
      "\n",
      "alloy to her many enjoyments.  The danger, however, was at present\n",
      "\n",
      "so unperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes\n",

      "with her.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Taylor's loss which first brought grief.  It was on the wedding-day\n",
      "\n",
      "of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought\n",
      "\n",
      "of any continuance.  The wedding over, and the bride-people gone,\n",
      "\n",
      "her father and herself were left to dine together, with no prospect\n",
      "\n",
      "of a third to cheer a long evening.  Her father composed himself\n",
      "\n",
      "to sleep after dinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit\n",
      "\n",
      "and think of what she had lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The event had every promise of happiness for her friend.  Mr. Weston\n",
      "\n",
      "was a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age,\n",
      "\n",
      "and pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering\n",
      "\n",
      "with what self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished\n",
      "\n",
      "and promoted the match; but it was a black morning's work for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day.\n",
      "\n",
      "She recalled her past kindness--the kindness, the affection of sixteen\n",
      "\n",
      "years--how she had taught and how she had played with her from five\n",
      "\n",
      "years old--how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse\n",
      "\n",
      "her in health--and how nursed her through the various illnesses\n",
      "\n",
      "of childhood.  A large debt of gratitude was owing here; but the\n",

      "intercourse of the last seven years, the equal footing and perfect\n",
      "\n",
      "unreserve which had soon followed Isabella's marriage, on their\n",
      "\n",
      "being left to each other, was yet a dearer, tenderer recollection.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed: intelligent,\n",
      "\n",
      "well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing all the ways of the family,\n",
      "\n",
      "interested in all its concerns, and peculiarly interested in herself,\n",
      "\n",
      "in every pleasure, every scheme of hers--one to whom she could speak\n",
      "\n",
      "every thought as it arose, and who had such an affection for her\n",
      "\n",
      "as could never find fault.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How was she to bear the change?--It was true that her friend was\n",
      "\n",
      "going only half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must\n",
      "\n",
      "be the difference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them,\n",
      "\n",
      "and a Miss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages,\n",
      "\n",
      "natural and domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering\n",
      "\n",
      "from intellectual solitude.  She dearly loved her father, but he\n",
      "\n",
      "was no companion for her.  He could not meet her in conversation,\n",
      "\n",
      "rational or playful.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had\n",
      "\n",
      "not married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits;\n",
      "\n",
      "for having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity\n",
      "\n",
      "of mind or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years;\n",
      "\n",
      "and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart\n",

      "\n",

      "to fill the house, and give her pleasant society again.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "to which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies,\n",
      "\n",
      "and name, did really belong, afforded her no equals.  The Woodhouses\n",
      "\n",
      "were first in consequence there.  All looked up to them.  She had\n",
      "\n",
      "many acquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil,\n",
      "\n",
      "but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss\n",
      "\n",
      "Taylor for even half a day.  It was a melancholy change; and Emma\n",
      "\n",
      "could not but sigh over it, and wish for impossible things,\n",
      "\n",
      "till her father awoke, and made it necessary to be cheerful.\n",
      "\n",
      "His spirits required support.  He was a nervous man, easily depressed;\n",
      "\n",
      "fond of every body that he was used to, and hating to part with them;\n",
      "\n",
      "hating change of every kind.  Matrimony, as the origin of change,\n",
      "\n",
      "was always disagreeable; and he was by no means yet reconciled\n",
      "\n",
      "to his own daughter's marrying, nor could ever speak of her but\n",
      "\n",
      "with compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection,\n",
      "\n",
      "when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from\n",

      "his habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to\n",
      "\n",
      "suppose that other people could feel differently from himself,\n",
      "\n",
      "he was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad\n",

      "a thing for herself as for them, and would have been a great deal\n",
      "\n",
      "happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could, to keep him\n",
      "\n",
      "from such thoughts; but when tea came, it was impossible for him\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family,\n",
      "\n",
      "which for the last two or three generations had been rising into\n",
      "\n",
      "gentility and property.  He had received a good education, but,\n",
      "\n",
      "on succeeding early in life to a small independence, had become\n",
      "\n",
      "indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers\n",
      "\n",
      "were engaged, and had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social\n",
      "\n",
      "temper by entering into the militia of his county, then embodied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances\n",
      "\n",
      "of his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill,\n",
      "\n",
      "of a great Yorkshire family, and Miss Churchill fell in love\n",
      "\n",
      "with him, nobody was surprized, except her brother and his wife,\n",
      "\n",
      "who had never seen him, and who were full of pride and importance,\n",
      "\n",
      "which the connexion would offend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command\n",
      "\n",
      "of her fortune--though her fortune bore no proportion to the\n",
      "\n",
      "family-estate--was not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it\n",
      "\n",
      "took place, to the infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill,\n",
      "\n",
      "who threw her off with due decorum.  It was an unsuitable connexion,\n",
      "\n",
      "and did not produce much happiness.  Mrs. Weston ought to have found\n",
      "\n",
      "more in it, for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper\n",
      "\n",
      "made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness\n",
      "\n",
      "of being in love with him; but though she had one sort of spirit,\n",
      "\n",
      "she had not the best.  She had resolution enough to pursue\n",
      "\n",
      "her own will in spite of her brother, but not enough to refrain\n",
      "\n",
      "from unreasonable regrets at that brother's unreasonable anger,\n",
      "\n",
      "nor from missing the luxuries of her former home.  They lived beyond\n",
      "\n",
      "their income, but still it was nothing in comparison of Enscombe:\n",
      "\n",
      "she did not cease to love her husband, but she wanted at once\n",

      "to be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of Enscombe.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills,\n",
      "\n",
      "as making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst\n",
      "\n",
      "of the bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years' marriage,\n",
      "\n",
      "he was rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved.\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy had, with the additional softening claim of a lingering\n",
      "\n",
      "illness of his mother's, been the means of a sort of reconciliation;\n",
      "\n",
      "and Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, having no children of their own,\n",
      "\n",
      "nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for, offered to\n",

      "\n",
      "Some scruples and some reluctance the widower-father may be supposed\n",

      "to have felt; but as they were overcome by other considerations,\n",
      "\n",
      "the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the Churchills,\n",
      "\n",
      "and he had only his own comfort to seek, and his own situation to\n",

      "improve as he could.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A complete change of life became desirable.  He quitted the militia\n",
      "\n",
      "and engaged in trade, having brothers already established in a\n",
      "\n",
      "good way in London, which afforded him a favourable opening.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a concern which brought just employment enough.  He had still\n",
      "\n",
      "a small house in Highbury, where most of his leisure days were spent;\n",
      "\n",
      "and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society,\n",
      "\n",
      "the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had, by that time, realised an easy competence--enough to secure\n",
      "\n",
      "the purchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury, which he had\n",
      "\n",
      "always longed for--enough to marry a woman as portionless even\n",

      "as Miss Taylor, and to live according to the wishes of his own\n",

      "friendly and social disposition.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "his schemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth\n",
      "\n",
      "on youth, it had not shaken his determination of never settling\n",
      "\n",
      "till he could purchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long\n",
      "\n",
      "looked forward to; but he had gone steadily on, with these objects\n",
      "\n",
      "in view, till they were accomplished.  He had made his fortune,\n",
      "\n",
      "bought his house, and obtained his wife; and was beginning a new\n",
      "\n",
      "period of existence, with every probability of greater happiness\n",
      "\n",
      "than in any yet passed through.  He had never been an unhappy man;\n",
      "\n",
      "his own temper had secured him from that, even in his first marriage;\n",
      "\n",
      "but his second must shew him how delightful a well-judging and truly\n",
      "\n",
      "amiable woman could be, and must give him the pleasantest proof\n",
      "\n",
      "of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen,\n",
      "\n",
      "to excite gratitude than to feel it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was\n",
      "\n",
      "his own; for as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought\n",
      "\n",
      "up as his uncle's heir, it had become so avowed an adoption\n",
      "\n",
      "as to have him assume the name of Churchill on coming of age.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was most unlikely, therefore, that he should ever want his\n",

      "\n",
      "The aunt was a capricious woman, and governed her husband entirely;\n",
      "\n",
      "but it was not in Mr. Weston's nature to imagine that any caprice\n",
      "\n",
      "could be strong enough to affect one so dear, and, as he believed,\n",
      "\n",
      "so deservedly dear.  He saw his son every year in London,\n",
      "\n",
      "and was proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fine\n",

      "\n",

      "not be doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it\n",

      "but I know no more what I said--I was in such a tremble!--I remember\n",

      "you know, one can't tell how; and then I took courage, and said it\n",

      "did not rain, and I must go; and so off I set; and I had not got\n",

      "\n",
      "He is not a gallant man, but he is a very humane one; and this,\n",

      "of humanity to him;--and for an act of unostentatious kindness,\n",

      "there is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr. Knightley.\n",
      "\n",

      "of it, the more probable it appears.  In short, I have made a match\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I see no probability in it, unless you have any better foundation\n",
      "\n",
      "than what you mention.  His good-nature, his humanity, as I tell you,\n",
      "\n",
      "would be quite enough to account for the horses.  He has a great\n",
      "\n",
      "regard for the Bateses, you know, independent of Jane Fairfax--\n",
      "\n",
      "and is always glad to shew them attention.  My dear Mrs. Weston,\n",

      "at Hartfield, and her father's being present to engage Mr. Elton,\n",
      "\n",
      "she had a quarter of an hour of the lady's conversation to herself,\n",

      "and could composedly attend to her; and the quarter of an hour quite\n",
      "\n",
      "convinced her that Mrs. Elton was a vain woman, extremely well\n",
      "\n",
      "satisfied with herself, and thinking much of her own importance;\n",
      "\n",
      "that she meant to shine and be very superior, but with manners which\n",
      "\n",
      "had been formed in a bad school, pert and familiar; that all her\n",
      "\n",
      "notions were drawn from one set of people, and one style of living;\n",

      "The grounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty; and the\n",

      "I really could not help exclaiming!  I assure you, Miss Woodhouse,\n",
      "\n",
      "it is very delightful to me, to be reminded of a place I am so\n",
      "\n",
      "extremely partial to as Maple Grove.  I have spent so many happy\n",

      "months there! (with a little sigh of sentiment). A charming place,\n",
      "\n",
      "undoubtedly.  Every body who sees it is struck by its beauty;\n",

      "and stand very much in the same way--just across the lawn;\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Weston.  He had met with them in a little perplexity,\n",

      "wanting _him_ to dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that their business\n",
      "\n",
      "was to help to persuade him into it, which was done pretty soon.--\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss\n",
      "\n",
      "Woodhouse followed.  Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton,\n",
      "\n",
      "though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her.\n",

      "undoubtedly the advantage, at this time, in vanity completely gratified;\n",
      "\n",
      "for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill, she could\n",

      "\n",
      "delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming,\n",
      "\n",
      "and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her.--\n",
      "\n",
      "She was more disturbed by Mr. Knightley's not dancing than by any\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "to be; he ought to be dancing,--not classing himself with the husbands,\n",
      "\n",
      "and fathers, and whist-players, who were pretending to feel an interest\n",
      "\n",
      "in the dance till their rubbers were made up,--so young as he looked!--\n",
      "\n",
      "He could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere,\n",
      "\n",
      "than where he had placed himself.  His tall, firm, upright figure,\n",
      "\n",
      "among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men,\n",
      "\n",
      "was such as Emma felt must draw every body's eyes; and, excepting her\n",
      "\n",
      "own partner, there was not one among the whole row of young men\n",
      "\n",
      "who could be compared with him.--He moved a few steps nearer,\n",

      "\n",
      "a manner, with what natural grace, he must have danced, would he\n",
      "\n",
      "but take the trouble.--Whenever she caught his eye, she forced him\n",

      "to smile; but in general he was looking grave.  She wished he could\n",
      "\n",
      "love a ballroom better, and could like Frank Churchill better.--\n",
      "\n",
      "He seemed often observing her.  She must not flatter herself that he\n",
      "\n",
      "thought of her dancing, but if he were criticising her behaviour,\n",
      "\n",
      "she did not feel afraid.  There was nothing like flirtation between\n",
      "\n",
      "her and her partner.  They seemed more like cheerful, easy friends,\n",
      "\n",
      "than lovers.  That Frank Churchill thought less of her than he had done,\n",
      "\n",
      "was indubitable.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be,\n",
      "\n",
      "was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of very important, very recordable events, it was not more productive\n",
      "\n",
      "than such meetings usually are.  There was one, however, which Emma\n",
      "\n",
      "thought something of.--The two last dances before supper were begun,\n",
      "\n",
      "and Harriet had no partner;--the only young lady sitting down;--\n",
      "\n",
      "and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers, that how there\n",
      "\n",
      "could be any one disengaged was the wonder!--But Emma's wonder\n",
      "\n",
      "lessened soon afterwards, on seeing Mr. Elton sauntering about.\n",
      "\n",
      "He would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided:\n",
      "\n",
      "she was sure he would not--and she was expecting him every moment to\n",
      "\n",
      "escape into the card-room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Escape, however, was not his plan.  He came to the part of the room\n",

      "where the sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about\n",
      "\n",
      "in front of them, as if to shew his liberty, and his resolution\n",
      "\n",
      "of maintaining it.  He did not omit being sometimes directly\n",
      "\n",
      "before Miss Smith, or speaking to those who were close to her.--\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma saw it.  She was not yet dancing; she was working her way\n",
      "\n",
      "up from the bottom, and had therefore leisure to look around,\n",
      "\n",
      "and by only turning her head a little she saw it all.  When she was\n",
      "\n",
      "half-way up the set, the whole group were exactly behind her, and she\n",
      "\n",
      "would no longer allow her eyes to watch; but Mr. Elton was so near,\n",
      "\n",
      "that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took\n",

      "place between him and Mrs. Weston; and she perceived that his wife,\n",
      "\n",
      "who was standing immediately above her, was not only listening also,\n",
      "\n",
      "but even encouraging him by significant glances.--The kind-hearted,\n",

      "extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting\n",

      "the Eltons, and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so\n",
      "\n",
      "much alike; and his praise of Harriet, his concession in her favour,\n",

      "quitted the ballroom, she had strong hopes.  It seemed as if her eyes\n",
      "\n",
      "were suddenly opened, and she were enabled to see that Mr. Elton\n",
      "\n",
      "was not the superior creature she had believed him.  The fever\n",

      "A child on the watch, came towards them to beg; and Miss Bickerton,\n",

      "\n",
      "and made the best of her way by a short cut back to Highbury.\n",

      "\n",
      "from cramp after dancing, and her first attempt to mount the bank\n",

      "\n",
      "her purse, gave them a shilling, and begged them not to want more,\n",
      "\n",
      "or to use her ill.--She was then able to walk, though but slowly,\n",

      "The terror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet\n",

      "\n",
      "I should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost,\n",

      "\n",
      "it was extremely natural:--and you agreed to it, expressing yourself\n",

      "\n",
      "the gipsies--it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant.  No! (with\n",
      "\n",
      "some elevation) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance--\n",
      "\n",
      "of Mr. Knightley's coming and asking me to dance, when Mr. Elton\n",
      "\n",
      "would not stand up with me; and when there was no other partner in\n",
      "\n",
      "the room.  That was the kind action; that was the noble benevolence\n",
      "\n",
      "and generosity; that was the service which made me begin to feel\n",

      "how superior he was to every other being upon earth.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "You must think one five hundred million times more above me than\n",
      "\n",
      "the other.  But I hope, Miss Woodhouse, that supposing--that if--\n",
      "\n",
      "strange as it may appear--.  But you know they were your own words,\n",
      "\n",
      "that _more_ wonderful things had happened, matches of _greater_ disparity\n",

      "it seems as if such a thing even as this, may have occurred before--\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma's eyes were instantly withdrawn; and she sat silently meditating,\n",
      "\n",
      "in a fixed attitude, for a few minutes.  A few minutes were sufficient\n",
      "\n",
      "for making her acquainted with her own heart.  A mind like hers,\n",
      "\n",
      "once opening to suspicion, made rapid progress.  She touched--\n",
      "\n",
      "she admitted--she acknowledged the whole truth.  Why was it\n",
      "\n",
      "so much worse that Harriet should be in love with Mr. Knightley,\n",
      "\n",
      "than with Frank Churchill?  Why was the evil so dreadfully increased\n",
      "\n",
      "by Harriet's having some hope of a return?  It darted through her,\n",
      "\n",
      "with the speed of an arrow, that Mr. Knightley must marry no one\n",
      "\n",
      "but herself!\n",

      "\n",

      "never blessed her before.  How improperly had she been acting\n",
      "\n",
      "by Harriet!  How inconsiderate, how indelicate, how irrational,\n",
      "\n",
      "how unfeeling had been her conduct!  What blindness, what madness,\n",
      "\n",
      "had led her on!  It struck her with dreadful force, and she\n",
      "\n",
      "was ready to give it every bad name in the world.  Some portion\n",
      "\n",
      "of respect for herself, however, in spite of all these demerits--\n",
      "\n",
      "some concern for her own appearance, and a strong sense of justice\n",

      "that the utmost extent of Harriet's hopes should be enquired into;\n",

      "to be slighted by the person, whose counsels had never led her right.--\n",
      "\n",
      "Rousing from reflection, therefore, and subduing her emotion,\n",

      "delight.--Emma's tremblings as she asked, and as she listened,\n",
      "\n",
      "were better concealed than Harriet's, but they were not less.\n",
      "\n",

      "that such a development of self, such a burst of threatening evil,\n",
      "\n",
      "such a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions, must create.--\n",

      "\n",
      "or very well delivered, it could not be expected to be;\n",

      "tautology of the narration, a substance to sink her spirit--\n",
      "\n",
      "especially with the corroborating circumstances, which her own memory\n",

      "to her much more than he had been used to do, and of his having\n",
      "\n",
      "indeed quite a different manner towards her; a manner of kindness\n",

      "and sweetness!--Latterly she had been more and more aware of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they had been all walking together, he had so often come and walked\n",
      "\n",
      "by her, and talked so very delightfully!--He seemed to want to be\n",

      "acquainted with her.  Emma knew it to have been very much the case.\n",

      "Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him--\n",
      "\n",
      "and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had\n",

      "art or affectation, for having simple, honest, generous, feelings.--\n",
      "\n",
      "She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet; he had dwelt\n",

      "many little particulars of the notice she had received from him, a look,\n",
      "\n",
      "a speech, a removal from one chair to another, a compliment implied,\n",
      "\n",
      "a preference inferred, had been unnoticed, because unsuspected,\n",

      "undiscerned by her who now heard them; but the two latest occurrences\n",
      "\n",
      "to be mentioned, the two of strongest promise to Harriet, were not\n",
      "\n",
      "without some degree of witness from Emma herself.--The first,\n",
      "\n",
      "was his walking with her apart from the others, in the lime-walk\n",
      "\n",
      "at Donwell, where they had been walking some time before Emma came,\n",
      "\n",
      "and he had taken pains (as she was convinced) to draw her from\n",
      "\n",
      "the rest to himself--and at first, he had talked to her in a more\n",
      "\n",
      "particular way than he had ever done before, in a very particular\n",
      "\n",
      "way indeed!--(Harriet could not recall it without a blush.) He seemed\n",
      "\n",
      "to be almost asking her, whether her affections were engaged.--\n",
      "\n",
      "But as soon as she (Miss Woodhouse) appeared likely to join them,\n",
      "\n",
      "he changed the subject, and began talking about farming:--\n",
      "\n",
      "The second, was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour\n",
      "\n",
      "before Emma came back from her visit, the very last morning of his\n",
      "\n",
      "being at Hartfield--though, when he first came in, he had said\n",
      "\n",
      "that he could not stay five minutes--and his having told her,\n",
      "\n",
      "during their conversation, that though he must go to London,\n",
      "\n",
      "it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all,\n",
      "\n",
      "which was much more (as Emma felt) than he had acknowledged to _her_.\n",
      "\n",
      "The superior degree of confidence towards Harriet, which this one\n",

      "article marked, gave her severe pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On the subject of the first of the two circumstances, she did,\n",

      "into the state of your affections, he might be alluding to Mr. Martin--\n",

      "his behaviour be the rule of mine--and so I have.  But now I seem\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Time passed on.  A few more to-morrows, and the party from London\n",
      "\n",
      "would be arriving.  It was an alarming change; and Emma was thinking\n",
      "\n",
      "of it one morning, as what must bring a great deal to agitate and\n",
      "\n",
      "grieve her, when Mr. Knightley came in, and distressing thoughts\n",
      "\n",
      "were put by.  After the first chat of pleasure he was silent;\n",
      "\n",
      "and then, in a graver tone, began with,\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have something to tell you, Emma; some news.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good or bad?\" said she, quickly, looking up in his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not know which it ought to be called.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! good I am sure.--I see it in your countenance.  You are trying\n",

      "not to smile.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am afraid,\" said he, composing his features, \"I am very much afraid,\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed! but why so?--I can hardly imagine that any thing which\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is one subject,\" he replied, \"I hope but one, on which\n",
      "\n",
      "we do not think alike.\"  He paused a moment, again smiling,\n",
      "\n",
      "with his eyes fixed on her face.  \"Does nothing occur to you?--\n",

      "Do not you recollect?--Harriet Smith.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "and her eyes, in eager gaze, said, \"No, this is impossible!\"\n",

      "one or the other of us think differently; and, in the meanwhile,\n",

      "we need not talk much on the subject.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy,\n",
      "\n",
      "but I cannot believe it.  It seems an impossibility!--You cannot mean\n",
      "\n",
      "to say, that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin.  You cannot\n",
      "\n",
      "mean that he has even proposed to her again--yet.  You only mean,\n",
      "\n",
      "that he intends it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I mean that he has done it,\" answered Mr. Knightley, with smiling\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good God!\" she cried.--\"Well!\"--Then having recourse to her workbasket,\n",
      "\n",
      "in excuse for leaning down her face, and concealing all the\n",
      "\n",
      "exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she\n",
      "\n",
      "must be expressing, she added, \"Well, now tell me every thing;\n",

      "make this intelligible to me.  How, where, when?--Let me know it all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I never was more surprized--but it does not make me unhappy,\n",
      "\n",
      "I assure you.--How--how has it been possible?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a very simple story.  He went to town on business three days ago,\n",
      "\n",
      "and I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting\n",
      "\n",
      "to send to John.--He delivered these papers to John, at his chambers,\n",
      "\n",
      "and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley's.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were going to take the two eldest boys to Astley's. The party\n",
      "\n",
      "was to be our brother and sister, Henry, John--and Miss Smith.\n",
      "\n",
      "My friend Robert could not resist.  They called for him in their way;\n",
      "\n",
      "were all extremely amused; and my brother asked him to dine with\n",
      "\n",
      "them the next day--which he did--and in the course of that visit\n",
      "\n",
      "(as I understand) he found an opportunity of speaking to Harriet;\n",
      "\n",
      "and certainly did not speak in vain.--She made him, by her acceptance,\n",
      "\n",
      "as happy even as he is deserving.  He came down by yesterday's coach,\n",
      "\n",
      "and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast, to report\n",
      "\n",
      "his proceedings, first on my affairs, and then on his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is all that I can relate of the how, where, and when.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your friend Harriet will make a much longer history when you see her.--\n",
      "\n",
      "She will give you all the minute particulars, which only woman's\n",
      "\n",
      "language can make interesting.--In our communications we deal only\n",
      "\n",
      "in the great.--However, I must say, that Robert Martin's heart seemed\n",
      "\n",
      "for _him_, and to _me_, very overflowing; and that he did mention,\n",
      "\n",
      "without its being much to the purpose, that on quitting their\n",
      "\n",
      "box at Astley's, my brother took charge of Mrs. John Knightley\n",
      "\n",
      "and little John, and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry;\n",
      "\n",
      "and that at one time they were in such a crowd, as to make Miss Smith\n",
      "\n",
      "rather uneasy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped.--Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply.  To speak,\n",
      "\n",
      "she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree\n",
      "\n",
      "of happiness.  She must wait a moment, or he would think her mad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her silence disturbed him; and after observing her a little while,\n",
      "\n",
      "he added,\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Emma, my love, you said that this circumstance would not now make\n",
      "\n",
      "you unhappy; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "His situation is an evil--but you must consider it as what satisfies\n",
      "\n",
      "your friend; and I will answer for your thinking better and better\n",
      "\n",
      "of him as you know him more.  His good sense and good principles would\n",
      "\n",
      "delight you.--As far as the man is concerned, you could not wish your\n",
      "\n",
      "friend in better hands.  His rank in society I would alter if I could,\n",
      "\n",
      "which is saying a great deal I assure you, Emma.--You laugh at me\n",
      "\n",
      "about William Larkins; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He wanted her to look up and smile; and having now brought herself\n",

      "\n",
      "In respectability of character, there can be no doubt that they are.\n",

      "I have been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize.\n",
      "\n",
      "You cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me! how peculiarly\n",
      "\n",
      "unprepared I was!--for I had reason to believe her very lately more\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "nothing doubtful, in the words he used; and I think I can give you\n",
      "\n",
      "a proof that it must be so.  He asked my opinion as to what he\n",

      "grow more worthy of him, whose intentions and judgment had been\n",
      "\n",
      "ever so superior to her own.  Nothing, but that the lessons\n",

      "\n",
